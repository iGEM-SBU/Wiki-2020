                Here at Stony Brook iGEM, we believe that educating people of all ages about
                synthetic biology is a primary directive.

            <p>June 15th 2020: Meeting with Co-Founder of HeartBeet Farms Jennifer Ross

Since we want to integrate our project in the agriculture sector, it is very important for us to talk to professionals in this field. We reached out to HeartBeet Farms, a local organic farm on Long Island and spoke to the Co-Founder, Jennifer Ross. Jen was very open to our questions and shared a lot of her insight. When we asked her about indoor farms, Jen said that she doesn't mind that the agriculture sector is advancing. She pointed out that as a consumer and a human being, she cared more about how nutritious the food grown in indoor farms is. Our team had never thought about that, thus Jen inspired us to reach out to BioNutrient Associations, a company that determines the nutrition of food. Another thing that Jen pointed out to us is that the reason she does not use GMOs is not necessarily because she is anti-GMO but rather that she does not have enough of the truth about GMOs. Our team felt that she was right, a lack of education and clarity does exist when it comes to GMOs. This encouraged us to make a handbook for farmers. Finally, Jen was able to help us by urging us to reach out to Emily Stevenson, a Stony Brook University alumna and a worker of Sang Lee.
